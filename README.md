# React User Directory App

This project is a React-based application that fetches and displays user information from the **JSONPlaceholder API**.  
Each user is displayed in a card layout with details such as name, email, phone, company, website, and address.  
Additionally, a unique avatar is generated for every user using the **DiceBear Avatars API**.  
The application also includes a loading spinner while data is being fetched.

- Displays user details in a clean card layout.
- Generates unique avatars for each user based on their `username`.
- Shows a **loading spinner** while data is being fetched.
